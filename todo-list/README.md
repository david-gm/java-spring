# Spring MVC

Based on the MVC design pattern:

- Model (M): models are responsible for the managing the application's data, business logic and business rules
- View (V): is an output representation of information, for example displaying information or reports to the user either as web form or as charts
- Controller (C): is responsible for invoking Models to perform business logic and then updating the view based on the Models output.

With Spring MVC we can use different view technologies to render web pages.
For example Groovy Markup, Freemarker and Thymeleaf. Spring MVC also integrates with other web frameworks.
